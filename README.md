# LinearAlgebraMatrixTool
I just wanted a basic tool for operating on matrices

* It can add or subtract any two rows
* It can multiply or divide any given row by a non-zero constant
* It can switch the location of any two rows

After each operation the table is printed showing 2 decimal places

## Usage
Before running the program you just need to hard code in the matrix you
want to start with.

## Warning
There are no test cases and there is almost no error handling for invalid input (beyond the scope of its purpose)
